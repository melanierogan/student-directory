## Student Directory ##

The student directory script allows you to manage a list of students enrolled at Villains Academy. I worked on this from Friday and over the weekend of Week 2. 

Where I have been trying different things which are suggested in each excercises I've added these to new directory. My final working file so far is: ```directory_7.rb```

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory_7.rb
```
